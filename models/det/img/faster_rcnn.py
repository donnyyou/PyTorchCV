class FasterRCNN(nn.Module):
    """Base class for Faster R-CNN.
    This is a base class for Faster R-CNN links supporting object detection
    API [#]_. The following three stages constitute Faster R-CNN.
    1. **Feature extraction**: Images are taken and their \
        feature maps are calculated.
    2. **Region Proposal Networks**: Given the feature maps calculated in \
        the previous stage, produce set of RoIs around objects.
    3. **Localization and Classification Heads**: Using feature maps that \
        belong to the proposed RoIs, classify the categories of the objects \
        in the RoIs and improve localizations.
    Each stage is carried out by one of the callable
    :class:`torch.nn.Module` objects :obj:`feature`, :obj:`rpn` and :obj:`head`.
    There are two functions :meth:`predict` and :meth:`__call__` to conduct
    object detection.
    :meth:`predict` takes images and returns bounding boxes that are converted
    to image coordinates. This will be useful for a scenario when
    Faster R-CNN is treated as a black box function, for instance.
    :meth:`__call__` is provided for a scnerario when intermediate outputs
    are needed, for instance, for training and debugging.
    Links that support obejct detection API have method :meth:`predict` with
    the same interface. Please refer to :meth:`predict` for
    further details.

        extractor (nn.Module): A module that takes a BCHW image
            array and returns feature maps.

            :class:`model.region_proposal_network.RegionProposalNetwork`.

        head (nn.Module): A module that takes
            a BCHW variable, RoIs and batch indices for RoIs. This returns class
            dependent localization paramters and class scores.
        loc_normalize_mean (tuple of four floats): Mean values of
            localization estimates.

            of localization estimates.
